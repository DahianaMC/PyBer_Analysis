# PyBer Analysis Report
Pyber data was provided to create visualizations to help to understand the data better.  Will allow the audience to absorb information quickly and detect patterns, trends, correlations and outliners.  Data visualizations are easy to share with teams to help project planning and drive decisions.  In this case Matplolib will be used to create the charts that visualize data in a Data Series or DataFrame.
## Background and Results
The data includes two files city_data and ride_data.  The city_data includes the city name, driver count by city and type of city.  The ride data includes city name per ride, date by ride made, the fare for each ride and the ride id.  We inspected the data for NaN values, and analize if the files can be merged.  Both data sets have the city name and was merged using this column to create a DataFrame.  Using the merged DataFrame we created 3 DataFrames for ecah type of city, then we computed the number of rides, the average fare and driver counts per city for each DataFrame by city type.  We incorporated the data calculated in a bubble chart and show the Total Number of Rides (Per City) vs Average Fare.
