# PyBer Analysis Report
Pyber data was provided to create visualizations to help to understand the data easier.  The visualizations will allow to absorb information quickly and detect patterns, trends, correlations and outliners.  Data visualizations are easy to share with teams to help project planning and drive decisions.  In this case Matplolib will be used to create the charts to visualize data from a Data Series or DataFrame.
## Background and Results
- The data includes two files city_data and ride_data.  The city_data includes the city name, driver count by city and type of city.  The ride data includes city name per ride, date by ride made, the fare for each ride and the ride id.  
- We inspected the data for NaN values, and analize if the files can be merged.  Both data sets have the city name and was merged using this column to create a DataFrame.  
- Using the merged DataFrame we created 3 DataFrames for each type of city: Urban, Suburban and Rural, then we computed the number of rides, the average fare and driver counts per city for each DataFrame by city type.  
- We incorporated the data calculated in a bubble chart and show the Total Number of Rides (Per City) vs Average Fare.
- The mean, median and mode were calculated for rides, fare and drivers by city type using different methods like pandas, numpy and SciPy.
- The box plots were created for ride count, ride fare and driver count by city type to check for outliers.
- After getting the percentages of fares, rides and drivers by city type, we created a pie chart for each of the variables (fares, rides and drivers).
- For Challenge of Module 5:
  - Need to create a DataFrame that summarizes the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type.
  - Create a multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week..
  - Write a report with the results.
